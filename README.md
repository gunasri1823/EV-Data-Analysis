## EV-Data-Analysis
This project showcases a comprehensive analysis of the Electric Vehicle (EV) dataset, visualized through an interactive dashboard built with Tableau. The analysis is supported by an Excel file that contains the processed data.

## Project Overview:
Objective: To provide insights into the electric vehicle population, trends, and distribution using data visualization techniques.
Tools Used: Tableau for dashboard creation, Excel for data processing.
Dataset: The dataset includes various attributes related to electric vehicles, such as model, year, manufacturer, and geographical distribution.

## Key Features of the Dashboard:
1. Interactive Charts and Graphs: The dashboard includes various visual elements like bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts, allowing users to explore the data from multiple angles.
2. Filters and Parameters: Users can apply filters to narrow down the data by specific attributes such as year, manufacturer, or region, making the exploration tailored to their interests.
3. Trend Analysis: The dashboard highlights trends over time, such as the increase in the number of electric vehicles, shifts in manufacturer dominance, and changes in geographical distribution.
4. Comparative Analysis: Users can compare different vehicle models, manufacturers, or regions to understand variations in EV adoption.
